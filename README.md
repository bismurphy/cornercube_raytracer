# cornercube_raytracer

Python script which traces rays as they interact with a corner-cube retroreflector. CAD file for retroreflector provided; compiles to the provided STL (which I tacked a .txt extension on for easy opening in text editor but by all means you can remove the .txt). Python script loads the STL and fires lasers at it until they re-exit the cube.

Please note: This raytracer is heavily over-fit to the exact CAD file provided here. Values are hard-coded in, since this is just meant as a minimal demo.

Feel free to fork and play with as you please; if you feel it is worth your time to improve this I will absolutely take pull requests :)
